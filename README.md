# Game Rental App


## Description
Welcome to my phase 5 project! This is a Game Rental App that is made in Python and React. It allows users to signup and if they are already a member then they can login. Once logged in the user can see a list of games that we have to rent from. If they have a game that is not on the list then they can use the add game form to add the game to the site and database. They can also edit the game if some information is incorrect and delete a game all together. The user can click on the games that they want to rent and those games will appear in their rental route. The user will only see the games that they are currently renting.
